# School_manager

This project consists of creating a website to allow administrators to manage a primary school.
A permission system will be created to differentiate a teacher from a head teacher

Here is a list of the tools I use in this project:

- Pencil: digital model or pencil paper
- Git : for version management
- JMerise: for data design models
- VisualParadigme: class, use case and sequence diagrams that I would be led to make.

I use NodeJs server side and ejs client side and i implement Passport.js to authenticate the user.
